## Future considerations
- [ ] Better autolayout handling with expanding/collapsing table view cells
- [ ] Enhance UI with more color, pictures, etc.
- [ ] Find / Create better icons for representing atmospheric opacity
- [ ] Display more data
- [ ] Settings page to choose F vs. C, date range of historical data, explanations of data, etc.
